# AI Image Detector

An intelligent tool built with Python and deep learning to determine whether an image is human-created or generated by an AI model. This project leverages computer vision techniques to analyze subtle artifacts and statistical patterns left by generative models, providing a probability score for its origin.

## üöÄ About The Project

In an era where AI-generated content is becoming increasingly common, distinguishing between authentic and synthetic media is crucial. This AI Image Detector serves as a practical tool for digital forensics and content verification, helping to combat misinformation and ensure media authenticity. The application provides a simple web interface where users can upload an image and receive an instant analysis.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Simple Web Interface:** Easy-to-use UI for uploading and analyzing images.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a trained TensorFlow/Keras model to classify images.
- **Real-time Analysis:** Get instant feedback on whether an image is likely AI-generated or not.
- **Lightweight Backend:** Built with Flask, making it efficient and easy to deploy.
